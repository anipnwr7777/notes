HTML defines positioning on the web page and every elements follows it's defined position in a normal flow


## Types
- Absolute : Placed relative to closed parent marked as "relative"
- Fixed : Fixed at a defined position on the webpage
- Relative : Placed relative to  itself
- Static : By default positioning is static
- Sticky : A sticky element toggles between relative and fixed, depending on the scroll position. It is positioned relative until a given offset position is met in the viewport - then it "sticks" in place (like position:fixed).
