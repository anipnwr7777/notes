# Notes : 

### Intention
The intention is to share quick personal notes and to help out the chai code community (even if 1 person is helped, motive is achieved)

### How to follow : 
- Root contains folders named 01, 02, 03 ... These are meant to contain broadly all things done for a given lecture.
- All the notes and the code done for each class including the assignments can be found inside the respective class/lecture folder.


**Notes** : 
- This is just for reference, don't follow blindly. DYOR.
- Though I have tried to cover everything, still some very basic things might get missed out. Reason : Everyone's notes will be different based on what they already know.
- I am open for suggestions/contributions.
- Please ignore any `hinglish` in the notes.
