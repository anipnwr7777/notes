# Notes : 

### Intention
The intention is to share quick personal notes and to help out the chai code community (even if 1 person is helped, motive is achieved)

### How to follow : 
- Files present at the root are named starting with 01 (means lecture 1), 02 (means lecture 2), .... 11 (means lecture 11)
- `src/` contains code supporting the live classes, no such numbering is followed over here, the names are self explanatory.
- For now all `html` documents are standalone and live server extension can be used to view the content on webpage.


**Notes** : 
- This is just for reference, don't follow blindly. DYOR.
- Though I have tried to cover everything, still some very basic things might get missed out. Reason : Everyone's notes will be different based on what they already know.
- I am open for suggestions/contributions.
- Please ignore any `hinglish` in the notes.
